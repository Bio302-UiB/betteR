# betteR

This project aims to help you write better code. 
Code could be better in many ways

- quicker to write
- easier to understand
- less error prone
- more reproducible
- faster

Unless your code runs very slowly, or your datasets are enormous, the speed of running code is not normally a problem, so we concentrate on the other aspects.

Tutorials included are

- 2-naming-objects.Rmd
- 5-pipes.Rmd

To run a tutorial, open the file in RStudio and click the `Run Document` button that appears above the text.
It will take a few moments to compile the tutorial, then it should open in a new window.
If you run the tutorials in the BIO302 workspace on Rstudio.cloud, all the packages should have been installed for you. 
If you run it on your own computer, you will need to install several packages.
